## Overview

The App seeks to present the user with detailed and accurate information via the openweatherAPI. Previous searches are remembered and weather information for the last searched city is presented on page load. This allows for a quick weather check for the city of your choice. The goal was to practice the imnplementation of a third party API and to then use the JSON information provided to update the page dynamically.
